      <h1>How I went from a social scientist to a computer scientist: a career change story</h1>

        <p>I like to call myself a lover of languages—both natural and programming. As a child I wrote up my own alphabet and taught it to my friends so we could write secret letters to one another. In high school I spent hours after class with my English teacher to ask about the origins of strange words from our Shakespeare reading. I didn’t care about Shakespeare, though: I was completely fascinated by how his knowledge of ancient Greek and Latin opened doors to different perspectives and interpretations of the same old story.</p>

        <p>My fascination with language as a lens through which we enhance our worldview unsurprisingly led me to study linguistics and international affairs during my undergraduate career. I have formally studied Spanish and Arabic and taken part in language immersion programs around the world. My international experiences connected me to varied professional positions where I married my love of language learning with
        humanitarian work through the years.</p>

        <p>After transferring to Northeastern University in 2016, I was working part-time at a local bakery when I had an idea to improve the quality of our refrigerated products by tracking shelf life in a structured manner. Waste reduction was a side effect of my solution as it led the team to place more informed orders from our supplier. When one of my favorite regular customers, a software engineer, once asked what I was working on, I showed him my color-coded data visualization of the display shelf and the steps I took to place orders using it. His reaction surprised me: his eyes lit up, he grabbed a pen and napkin, and started explaining to me how my little system was an algorithm (I had no clue what an algorithm was at the time). And just like that, I was inspired to take my first computer science course.</p>

        <p>I instantly found a crossover between language learning and programming. Both pursuits engage similar aspects of the intellect: creativity, organization, sequential processing, and appreciating the abstract. Over the years I have become obsessed with using software to solve practical problems while I continue to use my linguistic abilities to analyze social ones. After completing my master's degree, I plan to continue integrating both of my passions and use programming to transform and improve the lives of people around the world.</p>
